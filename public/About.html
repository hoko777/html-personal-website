    <h1>About ME</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>Welcome to my capstone project website! I'm [Your Name], a dedicated student with a passion for programming and technology. My expertise spans across various programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases, SAP, COBOL, JCL, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).</p>
    <p>Throughout my academic journey, I've immersed myself in the world of software development, mastering both traditional and modern programming paradigms. From designing responsive web interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to leveraging the power of databases for efficient data management, I've honed my skills to deliver robust and scalable solutions.</p>
    <p>In addition to my proficiency in web development and enterprise systems, I have a solid understanding of OOP principles, which allows me to design and implement modular, reusable, and maintainable code. Whether it's creating classes and objects in JavaScript or developing object-oriented applications in languages like Java or C++, I'm committed to writing elegant and efficient code that stands the test of time.</p>
    <p>Beyond the technical realm, I'm deeply fascinated by the limitless possibilities that technology offers in transforming businesses and society. With a collaborative mindset and a drive for continuous learning, I'm eager to leverage my skills and knowledge to make a meaningful impact in the world of software development.</p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my website and joining me on this journey. Feel free to explore my projects and reach out with any questions or feedback. Let's innovate and create together!</p>
